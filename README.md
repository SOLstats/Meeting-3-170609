# Meeting-3-170609
Third meeting 170609, H140.
Two examples of general linear hypothesis testing were given. 
The first example (glht1) is a 2 x 2 design for which all four pairwise comparisons were tested.
The second example (glht2) is an analysis with a continuous and a categorical predictor. The simple slopes of both regression lines were tested.
